# Plant Disease dectation using deeplearning
In plants, disease indications usually occur on leaves, fruit, buds, and young branches. This situation causes fruit to be wasted (to drop) or be damaged. In addition, these diseases lead to the formation of new infections and the spread of the disease for reasons such as seasonal conditions. For this reason, it is very important to determine the disease in advance and to take the necessary precautions before it spreads to other trees. 

In recent years, deep learning, which is especially widely used in image processing, offers many new applications related to precision agriculture. In this study, we evaluated the performance results using different approaches of nine powerful architectures of deep neural networks for plant disease detection. Transfer learning and deep feature extraction methods are used, which adapt these deep learning models to the problem at hand. The utilized pretrained deep models are considered in the presented work for feature extraction and for further fine-tuning. The obtained features using deep feature extraction are then classified by support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) methods. The experiments are carried out using data consisting of real disease and pest images
